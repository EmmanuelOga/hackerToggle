# HackerToggle

An extension to enable toggling of comments on hacker news threads.

## Installation

## TODO

HackerToggle doesn't change a lot the visual style of hacker news.
It would be nice to combine HackerToggle with other extensions like
[hn-special](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/hn-special).
